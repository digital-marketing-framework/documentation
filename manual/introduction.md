# Introduction

The Digital Marketing Framework (DMF) is there to connect two systems, that usually do not get along very well: A content management system (CMS) and and a customer relationship management system (CRM).

While a content management system is very good in creating and providing content, it usually does not have a lot of features when it comes to marketing strategies, nor does it have the data necessary to make smart decisions based on the user that is currently viewing the content.

A customer relationship management system, on the other hand, is very good in knowing a user's needs and providing relevant information, but it is not specialised in providing good tools for content creation.

The DMF is the bridge between these two systems so that both strengths can be used in the best possible way. It provides means to send user-generated data from the CMS to the CRM and also to retrieve user-specific data from the CRM so that it can be used to customise content for the user in the CMS.

The DMF consists of two domains which can be used independently from each other, though only if both being used will result in the DMF to perform to its full potential.

## Distributor

The [distributor](distributor/index.md) mechanisms of the DMF are there to relay user data from the CMS to the CRM. The most common kind of user data is a submitted form, but there can be other events and data sets as well.

## Collector

The [collector](collector/index.md) mechanisms of the DMF are there to retrieve data of the current user and moderate the content for the user accordingly.
